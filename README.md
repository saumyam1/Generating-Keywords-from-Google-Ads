# Generating-Keywords-from-Google-Ads
For a digital marketing agency, which is approached by a massive online retailer of furniture. The task was to create a prototype set of keywords for search campaigns for their sofas section. With my Python skills, I will try efficiently to create these keywords!  The most important task in structuring a search engine marketing account is mapping the right keywords to the right ads and making sure they send users to the right landing pages. Having figured that out is a big part of the account setup and makes the life of the account manager much easier.
